#### Render your component using Habitat

```js
import { render } from 'preact-habitat';
import WidgetAwesome from './components/WidgetAwesome'

render(WidgetAwesome);

```

#### Set Build tool output library type to UMD

example in Webpack:

```js

output: {
  ....
  libraryTarget: 'umd'
}

```

#### Host HTML integration

Now your widget is ready and assuming it's on your CDN and your URL is: `https://cdn.awesome/widget.js`
This is how easy it is to integrate in the host DOM

```html
<div id="external-widget-place">
  <script async src="https://cdn.awesome/widget.js"></script>
</div>
```

The snippet above will load the Preact component you have built inside a `div` with `external-widget-place` as id which you can position and style however you want.

#### Cloning multiple widgets

1. make a `<script>` tag and make sure `type="widget/config"`
2. add JSON config with the `clone` key of habitat script parent node `id` as a value

```html

<div id="external-widget-place">
  <script async src="https://cdn.awesome/widget.js"></script>
</div>

<script type="widget/config">
  {
    "clone": "external-widget-place"
  }
</script>

<script type="widget/config">
  {
    "clone": "external-widget-place"
  }
</script>

```

#### You're all set üéâ!

1. Please make sure your widget size is reasonable, bloated and big size bundles make puppies sick üê∂ üòî
2. Feel free to fork, contribute or give it a star. Open an issue or [chat with me](https://twitter.com/_zouhir) if you have any questions.
